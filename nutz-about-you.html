		<!-- Introduction -->
		<p><i><strong>Nutz 'bout U </strong>was a group project for the Game Design course in the Master of Digital Media Program.</i></p>
		<h4 class="article_header">Introduction</h4>
		<p><string>Nutz 'bout U</string> is a 2D mobile game where the gameplay centers around your ability to climb up a structure, while avoiding objects thrown at you from various characters that live or work around the environment that become your enemies. You must find Sarah, who is usually located at the top most level of the structure.</p>

		<h3 class="image_caption">The story of Tony</h3>
		<p>In the playable level, your weapon is acorns (nuts) that are scattered along your path to be collected. You can then aim and throw these nuts at the enemiesâ€™ window to stop them from attacking. If you get hit by an object, you will fall down one or two levels depending on the object thrown, so you must avoid falling further to the ground. Some enemies might make noise or shout at you. This would create a lot of attention that will eventually attract the police and will result in being arrested.</p>
		<p>On the later levels, there will be other challenges and mechanics such as a finite supply of nuts and different levels of enemies who carry increasingly intense and brutal attacks.</p>

		<!-- Challenge -->
		<h4 class="article_header">The Challenge</h4>
		<p>This was the first time I developed a mobile game. I was also fairly new to Unity and other tools for game development. As a result, my learning curve was very steep for 7 weeks of development.</p>
		<p>Aside from that, I also had to focus on learning about Game Design as it was the major part of the course.</p>
		
		<h4 class="article_header">Development Process</h4>
		<p>Like other projects I have done so far, this project followed Agile Methodology during the development process. Each iteration included: brainstorming the features, prototyping, testing and analyzing. We ended up with a better and higher-fidelity product after every iteration. </p>

		<h3 class="image_caption">Our first physical prototype</h3>
		<img src="images/nutz-about-u/cardsorting.jpg" class="article_image">
		<h3 class="image_caption">Our card sorting test</h3>
		<p>The final product was a horizontal slide of our game, which contains all the features that we designed in one level.</p>
		
		<h4 class="article_header">Lesson learned</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Unity with C#</li>
			<li>Game Development Process: <i>it is very important to keep iterating in order to find the pain points of the game, and figure out how to fix it. For a programmer, it is also more efficient to work closely with the artists/designers of the team to have the development done rapidly.</i></li>
			<li>Game Design: <i>We learned a lot about how to design the game mechanics, story and agency.</i></li>
			<li>Testing: <i>It is not recommended to test the product among the developers, because we are too familiar with the game and always find it much easier than it should be. Defining the main target audience and testing among them will give us a better idea of what should be improved.</i></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4 class="article_header">Team Members</h4>

		<p>Dave Fracchia and Jason Elliott for being our awesome professors.</p>
