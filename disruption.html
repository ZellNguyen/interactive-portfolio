		<!-- Introduction -->
		<h4 class="article_header">Introduction</h4>
		<p><strong><i>Disruption</i></strong> is a single player interactive narrative PC game that allows you to experience the psychological and real devastation caused by warfare. This surreal story offers a glimpse into the world of a soldier staving off post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and considering a path of resistance. With two paths before you, you must choose where you stand.</p>
		<p>This was the project for the Visual Storytelling course in the second term of the Master of Digital Media Program. </p>

		<h4 class="article_header">The Story</h4>
		<p>In a familiar yet fictional world, you are a soldier for a superpower that is rapidly colonizing the known world. You begin the story in the drone strike command centre. Your exploration of the space and drone strikes are completed through interactable objects. You must weigh the pressure to perform, with the mounting kill count and its impact on your own eroding mental health. </p>

		<h4 class="article_header">Game Development</h4>
		<p><strong><i>Disruption</i></strong> was developed in 4 weeks by Unity 5.6 Personal Version, using C# as the main programming language. It was exported for both Mac OSX and Windows versions.</p>

		<h3 class="image_caption">Disruption in Unity 5.6</h3>
		<p>In the project, I, one of two programmers, was in charge of creating a complete decision tree for the game that could minimize the number of required assets. In order to do that, I decided to write a static class, named <i>SceneArgumentsManager</i>, which is capable of storing and passing the arguments from scene to scene. This class can be accessed from any objects in the game. Each scene, therefore, contains an input object that reads the arguments as the input, and an output object that send out the arguments based on the decision the player makes.</p>

		<h3 class="image_caption">SceneArgumentManager static class</h3>
		<p>I also implemented the interactive environment for the game. Because there is a large number of interactable objects, I wrote a script that defines the <i>InteractableObject</i> class, which contains all the common attributes, as well as the methods of all the objects in the game.</p>
		
		<h4 class="article_header">Other Contribution</h4>
		<p>Aside from programming, I also took part in the project as a game designer and a video editor.</p>
		<p><strong><i>Disruption</i></strong> gameplay was designed for even a non-gamer to learn quickly, so that they can focus on the storyline. We want the player to be emotionally affected and to clearly understand the game's message through the decisions they make.</p>

		<p>Cutscene is another important factor of the game, which offers a glimpse of the soldier's PTSD. I made the cutscene videos by Adobe After Effect CC and Adobe Premiere Pro CC.</p>
